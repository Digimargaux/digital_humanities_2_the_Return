# digital_humanities_2_the_Return
Hello there and welcome to my Digital Humanities project. I realised that text mining had absolutely nothing to do with the data I have for my Master's thesis, so I decided to have a little fun for this final project (as always). Text mining means book, right ? And what is a better book than the Lord of the Rings ? This is my favorite book trilogy so I decided to work with it. For your information, and even though no one care, my favourite character from the Lord of the Rings is Pippin. I've always felt like there was a mixed feeling about him, so I decided to run a Sentiment analysis on the sentences in which he appears to get an idea of which sentiment is prominent when Pippin's around.
