# digital_humanities_2_the_Return
Hello and welcome to my Digital Humanities project. I can't really use any text-mining for my own data so I decided to have fun with a text analysis of the Lord of the Rings books. I wanted to have an idea of what kind of feelings were associated with Pippin in the books so a ran two sentiment analyses on R. The first analysis was on a dataset of the sentences in the Fellowship of the Ring in which Pippin is mentioned, the second analysis was on a dataset of all the interactions I found between Pippin and Gandalf in all three books. Enjoy !
