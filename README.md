# digital_humanities_2_the_Return
Hello there and welcome to my Digital Humanities project. I can't really use any text-mining for my own data so I decided to have fun with a text analysis of the Lord of the Rings books. I wanted to have an idea of what kinds of feelings were associated with Pippin inthe books so a ran two sentiment analyses on R. Enjoy !
